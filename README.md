## What's New in Phase 4?
1. An all new React based Frontend for the entire site including new registration, login, home, and account pages!
2. Fixes for the frequent issues of broken poster images and mismatching posters.
3. Optimzied backend to utilize only 1 API ([The Movie Database](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)).
4. Cast and Director information shown for each movie.
5. Cleaned CSV data files to produce better recommendations and results on the frontend.
6. 60 new Test cases (previously just 19)!
7. Tested expansion of movies and ratings database (see #4 in [Future Project Plan](https://github.com/Joshi-Karan/MovieRecommender_Fall24/tree/stableF24?tab=readme-ov-file#future-project-plan-))

## Future Project Plan üîÆ

The following changes can take this project to an even greater level:

1. Create page to only display movies of each director, actor, or genre when the name is clicked on.
2. Enhance the user profile page to display liked, disliked, and saved movies in a clean way.
3. Remove search functionality and suggest recommendations on home page based off user likes and dislikes.
4. Phase 4 tested an expansion of the movies.csv and ratings.csv file from 9k movies and 100k ratings to 87k movies and 32M ratings, but did not include because it would be a great opportunity for a future phase to pick up these files from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/32m/) and figure out the best sampling method to incorporate the new data into the existing code.
5. Improve recommendations response speed.

Note: Our system can be virtually tested through Github Actions inbuilt feature of build and test queries using python.

## Working üì±

- Below working displays the system also evaluates movie attributes such as genre, cast, director, and user-generated reviews. 
- By combining these user-specific data and film characteristics, the recommender system employs machine learning to generate tailored movie recommendations.
- This enables users to discover new films that align with their individual tastes, making the movie-watching experience more enjoyable and engaging. 
- Furthermore, recommender systems often employ a feedback loop, where users' interactions and feedback help refine the recommendations over time, ensuring that the suggestions remain relevant.
